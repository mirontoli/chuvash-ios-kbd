#Evolutions of Chuvash Keyboard for iOS

The purpose of this page is to document the process and provide material for discussion. There is no official keyboard layout for Chuvash. The discussions are often very infected. Every significant change in the layout is called evolution. The most recent evolutions are listed first. Every documented evolution has a number and its source code and screenshots is in the folder [evolutions](evolutions)
