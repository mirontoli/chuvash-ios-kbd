#Evolutions of Chuvash Keyboard for iOS

The purpose of this page is to document the process and provide material for discussion. There is no official keyboard layout for Chuvash. The discussions are often very infected. Every significant change in the layout is called evolution. The most recent evolutions are listed first. Every documented evolution has a number and its source code and screenshots is in the folder [evolutions](evolutions)

# Evolution 7
Russian letters that are seldom used are remove (Б, Г...) They are going to be moved to the second and third screens.

## Early work - 2014

In 2014 we did a great investment in analyzing the feasibility, building prototypes, discussing and analyzing Chuvash letters with the community and Chuvash philologists. 

The work was documented in a google document that is now saved as a pdf:
